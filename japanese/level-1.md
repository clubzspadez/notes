### Introduction to Japanese Pronunciation

**The Basics of Timing**

Japanese is what is called a "mora-timed" language. What this simply means is that every character in Japanese - which you can think of as a syllable, occupies the same length of time.
No character takes up more *or* less time than the other characters. Every character is valued equally and is pronounced evenly throughout.


English, on the other hand, is a "stress-timed" language. Syllables that are stressed, are valued greater than syllables that are unstressed.
This gives English a "machine-gun" like rhythm, where the pace is sometimes fast, and at other times, slow.

Because equal value is given to each character, there is no word-stress in Japanese.

**Pronouncing Japanese Characters**

There are five characters in Japanese that signify a vowel sound...
あ、い、う、え、お (a, i, u, e, o)
Apart from these five characters, all other characters - except for one that we will cover shortly - is made up of a consonant sound and one of these vowel sounds.


か、き、く、け、こ (ka, ki, ku, ke, ko)

さ、し、す、せ、そ (sa, shi, su, se, so)

た、ち、つ、て、と (ta, chi, tsu, te, to)
... and so on.


Only ん (n) is kind of special. It's a consonant sound, without a vowel sound.

So to recap, a Japanese character could be:

- a vowel, e.g. あ (a)
- made up of one consonant and one vowel, e.g. か (ka)
- ん (n), which is a consonant sound on its own.

Now you know the possible sounds that make up a Japanese *character*, but let's look at ALL the sounds in Japanese collectively.
You already know roughly 80% of ALL sounds in Japanese. That means that if you were to simply imitate a Japanese speaker, your pronunciation would be correct roughly 80% of the time!

Let's consider the word わさび (wasabi).
"W" ,"S", and "B" sounds in this Japanese word are identical to English.
