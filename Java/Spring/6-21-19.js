//* What is spring?
` Most often, when people say 'Spring', the mean the entire family of projects.`
/*
* - The spring Framework
* - Spring Boot
* - Spring Data
* - Spring Cloud
* - Spring Batch
* - and more...
*
! Spring Framework
*
* - Web
* - Data
* - AOP
* - Core
*  Allows developers the ease of access to setup certain projects in java.
* - Some other spring projects are Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
*  - These projects are all built on each other and the spring framework.
*
*
! Why use Spring?
*
* - Spring started as a response to the complexity of J2EE or Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition(now Java EE)
? What is J2EE: -> Checking questions section at bottom of notes
* - Today, Spring is more than an alternative to Java EE, its complimentary to Java EE
* - Spring makes it easy to create java enterprise applications
*
*  It's:
*   1. Flexible, modular, and backwards compatible
*   2. Has a large and active community
*   3. Continually innovates and adapts to current standards
*
*  Notable features:
*   - auto-configuration
*   - standalone
*   - opinionated
*
*  How Auto config works - 'Contextually aware and smart'
*
*  Example: If my application depends on a database related dependency then
*  auto config will configure the app for for database access

/*
*
* What is J2EE?
*  * A platform-independent, Java-centric environment from Sun for developing,
*    building and deploying Web-based enterprise applications online.
*  * Some key features:
*    - At the client tier, J2EE supports pure HTML, as well as Java applets or applications.
*      It relies on Java Server Pages and servlet code to create HTML or other formatted data for the client.
*
*    - Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) provide another layer where the platform's logic is stored.
*      An EJB server provides functions such as threading, concurrency, security and memory management. These services are transparent to the author.
*    - Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), which is the Java equivalent to ODBC, is the standard interface for Java databases.
*    - The Java servlet API enhances consistency for developers without requiring a graphical user interface.
