//! Purpose of the Scrum Guide
//* Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. 
//* This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. 
//* This definition consists of Scrumâ€™s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. 
//* Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum; the Scrum Guide is written and provided by them. 
//* Together, they stand behind the Scrum Guide.


/*
* 
* 3 Major Types of Methodologies 
#-> Waterfall (SDLC the most common type)
 *   -Oldest
 *   -Good for non-changing requirements
#-> Spiral
 *   -All about prototyping
 *   -Can imbed other Methodologies
#-> Agile
 *   -Is incremental, focuses on short feedback cycles
 *   -16+ different Methodologies including XP, SCRUM, Kanban & APM
 *   -Requires most experience & integration of team 


 !TERMS

 $ Agile
* a set of software development practices designed to help engineers work together and adapt to changes quickly and easily.
$ Artifact
   * a physical or virtual tool used by a scrum team to facilitate the scrum process
   * in this case the product backlog which helps the team identify wish list items, features, bugs, etc
   * sprint backlog which would contain list of features,bugs, and changes
$ Blocker
  *  anything keeping an engineer from moving forward on a task in progress
$ Customer
   * whoever has engaged the team to create a product
$ Engineer/Developer
   * a person responsible for creating and maintaining the technology that goes into a product
$ Engineering Organization
   * the part of a company where engineers are employed to create and maintain products
$ Product
   * what the engineering organization is building or maintaining for a customer
$ Product backlog
   * a constantly evolving list of potential features or changes for a product
$ Product owner
   * a person who helps define the product for the team, and whose job may be on the line if the customer isn't satisfied
$ Retrospective
   * a regular opportunity for the team to reflect on how they are doing, and what they could do better
$ Ritual
   * a group of people coming together as part of the scrum process for a fixed time, with a specified agenda, to achieve a clearly defined outcome
$ Scrum Master
  *  a person responsible for maintaining the artifacts and overseeing the rituals of scrum
$ Sprint
  *  a fixed number of days during which the team can work together to produce an agreed upon set of changes to the product
$ Sprint backlog
  *  a finite and well-defined set of stories the team has agreed they can reasonably complete in the current sprint
$ Story
  *  a clear and consistent way of chunking, phrasing, and discussing work the team may need to do on the product
$ User
  *  a person who will be making use of the product



  ! Time Sensitivity 
    ? By using customer data we can integrate ideas from the team 
    ? allowing an iterative approach that encourages learning as you go
    # good for adapting to technologies and market changes

  ! Modular Development
   # scrum  is based on thinking in terms of slices of functionality
   # allowing modular features to be mixed together
   # 

  ! Flexible Scheduling
  * using sprints 
  *
  *

  !Reflection and improvement
  # constant improvement in the process 



! WIP - Work In Progress
